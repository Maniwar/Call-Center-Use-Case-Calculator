## Key Concepts

### 4-Level Cost Hierarchy
The application uses a sophisticated cost model with clear priority order:

1. **Special Groups** (Highest Priority)
   - Nested within specific category-channel combinations
   - Example: "Senior Agents" for "Technical Support" + "Phone" channel
   - Can have different costs per category-channel combination

2. **Category-Channel Overrides** 
   - Override defaults for specific category-channel pairs
   - Example: "Pre-Sales" category via "Chat" channel costs more than email

3. **Category Defaults**
   - Default costs for entire business categories
   - Example: "Technical Support" has different base costs than "Order Support"

4. **Channel Defaults** (Lowest Priority)
   - Fallback costs when no higher-level override exists
   - Example: Phone = $6, Chat = $2.50, Email = $4, etc.

### Agent Utilization
Real contact centers factor in non-productive time:
- **Utilization Rate**: Percentage of time agents spend on productive work (60-85% typical)
- **Impact**: Lower utilization = higher true cost per contact
- **Formula**: `True Hourly Cost = Base Hourly Rate √ó (100 / Utilization %)`
- **Example**: $20/hr at 75% utilization = $26.67/hr effective rate

### Pricing Models
Each cost level supports two pricing approaches:
- **Per-Contact**: Direct cost per interaction (e.g., $8 per contact)
- **Hourly**: Agent wage converted using AHT and utilization
  - Formula: `Per-Contact Cost = (Hourly Rate √ó AHT minutes √∑ 60) √ó Utilization Factor`
  - Example: $20/hr √ó 15min √∑ 60 √ó 1.33 utilization = $6.65 per contact

### Calculation Formulas

**Deflection/Automation/Resolution/Transfer Metrics:**
```
Savings = Volume √ó (Improvement% - Baseline%) √ó Effective Cost per Contact
```

**AHT Reduction Metric:**
```  
Savings = Volume √ó Minutes Saved √ó (Effective Cost per Contact √∑ AHT minutes)
```

**Cost Priority Logic:**
The system automatically selects the most specific cost available:
1. Special Group cost for the use case's category-channel (if assigned)
2. Category-Channel override cost (if configured)  
3. Category default cost (if configured)
4. Channel default cost (always available)

## Usage Guide

### Initial Setup
1. **Configure Basic Settings**
   - Click the ‚öôÔ∏è Settings icon in the top-right
   - Set **Default AHT** (Average Handle Time in minutes)
   - Set **Agent Utilization** percentage (75% recommended)
   - Configure **Channel Default Costs** for your 6 channels

2. **Set Up Cost Structure** 
   - Add **Categories** (e.g., "Technical Support", "Pre-Sales", "Order Support")
   - For each category, optionally set **Category-Channel Overrides**
   - Add **Special Groups** within specific category-channel combinations
   - Toggle between **Hourly** and **Per-Contact** pricing as needed

3. **Define Analysis Period**
   - Set start and end dates for your ROI analysis
   - The system will generate month-by-month tracking

### Creating Use Cases
4. **Add AI Use Cases**

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Technical Support Deflection
- **Setup**: Technical Support category, Phone channel, "Tier 2" special group
- **Costs**: $25/hour with 12-minute AHT at 75% utilization
- **Calculation**: $25 √ó (12/60) √ó (100/75) = $6.67 per contact
- **Use Case**: 85% deflection rate with 10% baseline ‚Üí 75% net improvement
- **Monthly Volume**: 500 contacts
- **Savings**: 500 √ó 75% √ó $6.67 = **$2,501 per month**

### Scenario 2: Pre-Sales Chat Automation  
- **Setup**: Pre-Sales category, Chat channel, no special group
- **Costs**: $4.50 per contact (direct per-contact pricing)
- **Use Case**: 60% automation rate with 5% baseline ‚Üí 55% net improvement
- **Monthly Volume**: 800 contacts  
- **Savings**: 800 √ó 55% √ó $4.50 = **$1,980 per month**

### Scenario 3: AHT Reduction for Order Support
- **Setup**: Order Support category, Email channel
- **Costs**: $18/hour with 8-minute AHT at 80% utilization  
- **Calculation**: $18 √ó (8/60) √ó (100/80) = $3.00 per contact
- **Use Case**: 3-minute AHT reduction (from 8min baseline)
- **Monthly Volume**: 1,200 contacts
- **Per-minute cost**: $3.00 √∑ 8 = $0.375 per minute
- **Savings**: 1,200 √ó 3 √ó $0.375 = **$1,350 per month**

## Best Practices

### Cost Configuration
- **Start Simple**: Begin with channel defaults, add complexity as needed
- **Use Industry Benchmarks**: 
  - Phone: $6-8 per contact or $20-35/hour
  - Chat: $2-4 per contact or $15-25/hour  
  - Email: $3-5 per contact or $18-28/hour
- **Factor Utilization**: Most centers operate at 65-80% utilization
- **Regular Updates**: Review and adjust costs quarterly

### Use Case Design
- **Set Realistic Baselines**: Use current performance as baseline (not zero)
- **Conservative Projections**: Better to under-promise and over-deliver
- **Segment Appropriately**: Different categories may have different improvement potentials
- **Track Leading Indicators**: Monitor volume trends and early performance signals

### Analysis & Reporting
- **Multi-dimensional Views**: Analyze by category, channel, and time period
- **Variance Analysis**: Compare projected vs. actual improvements
- **Cost Transparency**: Always show calculation sources in reports
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Use charts and summaries for executive reporting
