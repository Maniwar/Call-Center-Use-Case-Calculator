## Version 2.1.0 - Export Functions Enhancement (2025-09-12)

### üéØ Overview
Major improvements to all export functions with focus on Excel formula accuracy, object serialization fixes, and enhanced Analytics export capabilities.

### ‚ú® New Features

#### **Analytics Excel Export**
- Added Excel export button to all Analytics views (Overall, Category, Channel, Benefit, Use Case, Special Group)
- Generates Excel files with live formulas that auto-calculate
- Formulas adjust based on metric type for accurate calculations
- Supports percentage calculations and totals

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### **Critical: Object Serialization Issues**
- **Fixed**: `[object Object]` appearing in CSV and Excel exports
- **Impact**: Channel costs can now be either simple numbers or complex objects with `{value, costType, ahtMinutes}`
- **Solution**: Added helper functions to properly extract values from channel cost objects

#### **Excel Formula Accuracy**
- **Fixed**: AHT formulas using hardcoded value of 10 instead of actual AHT
- **Impact**: AHT calculations now properly use configured AHT values per use case
- **Example**: Formula now shows `=G10*MIN(J10,8.00)*0.7500` for 8-minute AHT instead of hardcoded 10

#### **Missing Metric Types in Excel**
- **Fixed**: Transfer Rate Reduction, Self-Service Resolution, and other metrics falling through to wrong formulas
- **Impact**: All metric types now generate correct Excel formulas matching UI calculations
- **Solution**: Centralized metric configuration in METRIC_CONFIG object

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### **Code Maintainability**
1. **Helper Functions Added**:
   - `getChannelCostValue(channel)` - Extracts cost value from channel object
   - `getChannelCostType(channel)` - Gets cost type (hourly/perContact)
   - `getChannelAHT(channel)` - Gets AHT minutes with fallback to default

2. **Centralized Configuration**:
   - METRIC_CONFIG object serves as single source of truth
   - All metric types, formulas, and Excel formula generators in one place
   - Easy to add new metrics without code duplication

3. **Formula Generation**:
   - Consistent formula generation between JavaScript and Excel
   - Type-based calculation dispatch
   - Proper handling of all edge cases
